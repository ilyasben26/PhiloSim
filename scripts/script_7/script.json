        "name": "Socrates",
        "message": "Ah, I see your point, Nietzsche. But should we not be cautious of the dangers of relativism? If truth is merely a matter of perspective, can we distinguish between genuine knowledge and mere belief?"
    },
    {
        "name": "Nietzsche",
        "message": "You raise a valid concern, Socrates. Relativism can indeed lead to intellectual laziness and a lack of critical thinking. We must never abandon our pursuit of truth, even in the face of subjectivity."

    {
        "name": "Nietzsche",
        "message": "Perhaps, Socrates. But we must also consider the potential for oppressive power structures to emerge from the belief in a universal morality. Postmodernism reminds us to critically examine the moral values imposed upon us."
